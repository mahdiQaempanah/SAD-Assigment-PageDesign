# SAD-Assigment-PageDesign

In a project assigned for the Systems Analysis and Design course, we were required to design web pages based on the specific requirements of each question.

### Question 1
In this question, we had to optimize the login page and the main chatGPT page for programmers. Therefore, our main page is designed with a dark theme as programmers usually prefer dark themes. Additionally, the main page features the ability to upload multiple pieces of code related to each other so that programmers can ask questions about them.

### Question 2
In this question, we were tasked with designing a dashboard for an educational course that is responsive for both mobile and desktop screens. The dark mode for this dashboard is also designed. Each dashboard consists of 4 sections including exercises, Q&A, notifications, and course materials. For each item, functionalities such as asking questions, requesting extensions, and submitting answers are provided.
